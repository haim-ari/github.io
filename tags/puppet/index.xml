      <description>Why i moved to MasterLess Puppet for our AWS autoscaled Groups ? In general this is because having multiple puppet masters is not so fun, especially if you are using Foreman. I don’t want to have another Puppet master in each site and having to sync all the facts between them.
MasterLess puppet has one disadvantage: any host/instance needs to have all modules available on itself. Once you get use to that (it’s a one time configuration) the rest is easy and you are no longer depending on you Puppet master to apply modules.</description>
