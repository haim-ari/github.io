      <title>Automatically Launch AWS Instances With Dyn</title>

      <description>Dyn can provide a very simple solution for fail over. When you have a network outage in your primary Data Center you want to fail over as soon as possible. I use Dyn DNS “FailOver” feature to determine if a service is completely down on a site. you can use a simple http check and parse the response. Then the script launches X number of instances in AWS as soon as it detects the “Error” status.</description>

      <description>Here is a script that should run on an AutoScale instance when it launches and terminates in order to set and remove hostname by the instance-id. This script will: 1. Update the instance hostname (locally) by instance id 2. Create Dyn DNS records for public and private IPs, then publish zone 3. Update the Instance Name in AWS by Instance-id + domain 4. removes records from Dyn Dns when instance terminates.</description>

      <title>Ansible (Tower) as your rolling deployment system</title>

      <description>Ansible is a great tool to manage your servers. The ability to launch commands at the same time on all or some of your agent-less hosts makes it very powerful. The open source part of Ansible allows you to run any command/task/playbook/role on your hosts by using commands. If you want to create a pipeline there is no such option… that is where Ansible Tower comes in.
Ansible Tower allows you to easily use the same playbooks you created in a UI interface.</description>
