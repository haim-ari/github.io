      <description>USING GITLAB AS YOUR PRODUCTION CI / CD SYSTEM ? YES, YOU SHOULD  Gitlab is a complete solution to unify your deployments and create a robust infrastructure tool, to manage your organization environments.
 This is another take on a previous post i wrote last year, in which i needed to adopt a new product into the company, this product required building from scratch since it was relatively old and based on old technologies.</description>

      <description>Auto Scale
 In this post i’ll describe how i use AWS Auto Scale in our environment.
If you have not read about AWS Auto Scale Group yet, i recommend reading this document
Now that you know what is Auto-Scaling and what are the features and benefits, lets go over it.
In general what Auto-scale means is that instances will launch automatically by the policy you define, and will start serving by adding themselves to your Auto Scale Group ELB.</description>

      <title>Ansible (Tower) as your rolling deployment system</title>

      <description>Ansible is a great tool to manage your servers. The ability to launch commands at the same time on all or some of your agent-less hosts makes it very powerful. The open source part of Ansible allows you to run any command/task/playbook/role on your hosts by using commands. If you want to create a pipeline there is no such option… that is where Ansible Tower comes in.
Ansible Tower allows you to easily use the same playbooks you created in a UI interface.</description>
